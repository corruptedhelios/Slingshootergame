# Slingshootergame
the real one

To play the game OrbShooter, please run the Orbshooter.exe in the SlingshooterBasic-master folder.
It is recommended to play the game in a 1280x720 resolution or lower since some of the UI elements change depending on the screen size. Windowed mode as well as graphic settings do not matter. However windowed mode gets rid of possible black bars on the edges.
To play the game just press the start-button. Spawn an orb by klicking on the Statue with the glowing light and drag and release the orb to launch it.
